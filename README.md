# PID-Lego-Proximity-Control

This projects has demonstrations of PID control to get to a required distance away from an object by controlling speed.
This principle is then applied to a Lego Mindstorms EV3 robot by controlling the motor speed with PID control based on the error of the proximity detected by the IR proximity sensor.
